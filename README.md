# NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING- FINAL PROJECT; ANALYZING VIC SCORE VOLATILITY AND JEROME POWELL STATEMENTS

The files in this repository correspond to the group project investigating the relationship between VIX score volatility and Federal Reserve Contractionary/Expansionary Sentiment.
This content was created as the final project for a QMSS Natural Language Processing Class at Columbia University, with the aim of implementing NLP techniques used in class into an independent group research project. 

With the main objective being to better understand how speeches delivered by Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell relate to the VIX volatolity index, we extracted and analyzed the 30 most recent Federal Reserve Statements from the official website, applied preprocessing techniques, including stopword removal, lemmatization, and tokenization, and conducted statistical analysis with changes in the vix score throughout the past three years. The analysis included hypothesis testing and regression analysis, and we overall found some signs of statistically significant associations between 3-day changes in the VIX score, and the use of expansionary vocabularity.


The repository includes a copy of our final presentation, the literature review of the assignment used as a framework for the methodology, and a draft of the final project.
